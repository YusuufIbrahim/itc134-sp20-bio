I am a young proffesional based in Seattle, Washington currently persuing higher education in order to become a software developer. Growing up in a city like Seattle and always being around technology has inspired me to find my calling in the tech field.
Family and Friends mean the world to me, so I always make sure to find time for them. When im around the people I care about I feel a sense of peace and relief knowing I can kick back and take a break from my busy schedule.
staying fit is important to me, I keep fit by going on daily walks/runs and keeping an eye on my calorie intake. 
I ejoy getting to know new people, you never know what you might be able to add to someone's life postively or if they might even have a postive impact on you.
